  - bugfix: "Heretics can finally summon Ash Men, as the Eldritch Powers that grant them their power accidentally messed up the recipe."
  - balance: "Those crafty Heretics have gone eco-friendly, and are now creating Ash Men and Rust Walkers with stomachs and lungs respectively, rather than heads."
