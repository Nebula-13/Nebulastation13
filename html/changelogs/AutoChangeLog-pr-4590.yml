  - bugfix: "NanoTrasen recruitment policies have now been updated! No more pacifistic security officers or heads of staff!"
  - bugfix: "For that matter, heads of staff with serious disabilities are also no longer being hired! Take it up with the disability equality commission if you must!"
  - bugfix: "NanoTrasen Captains are now subject to the same recruitment guidelines as the other heads! Why they already weren't may remain a mystery forever."
