  - refactor: "The explosive compressor and blastcannon now actually use the bombs they are given. Both have experienced slight changes to their response times as a result."
  - code_imp: "The explosion severity definitions are now the right way round."
  - code_imp: "Most explosions now use named arguments and occur at the exploding object instead of its turf."
